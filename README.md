* **Presentation** is the slides
* **node** is a small insecure node.js app
* **singlepage** is a insecure single page webapp built with poorly written rails and backbone.js


node and singlepage are two really **insecure** webapps. **Do NOT use the 
code** for anything except show how poorly code can be written and how 
insecure an app can be.


Some details on the singlepage app. It lacks proper server side security
controls, meaning you can manipulate the client side to become admin etc.
You can also do mass assignments, and mess around with the API.
